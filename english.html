        <p>Come join us at Lohja in May 2015, when all Finnish Lindy Hoppers meet at Swing Spring 2015! Our amazing teachers will make you learn and enjoy dancing, while live music and DJs will make you dance and swing on evening parties.</p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>Swing Spring is a Lindy Hop camp, meaning that Lindy Hop will be taught daily. In addition to Lindy, we will have elective classes and tasters on other dances or subjects, so that they promote the general idea of the camp.</p>

        <h2>Parties</h2>
        <p>There will be total of four nights of dancing during Swing Spring 2015, starting from Wednesday until Saturday! During this time we'll also have exciting competitions and performances. </p>
        <h2>Competitions</h2>
        <p>Two different lindy hop competitions will be arranged during Swing Spring 2015. Both of them are improvised social dance contests so no choreographies or special skills are required. Competition entry is included in the prices of the camp and party tickets, though a qualifying round may be arranged in the early evening before the party starts. The best way to register for the competitions is to do it while registering for the event.</p>
        <h2>Cabaret</h2>
        <p>On Saturday night there will be a cabaret. All kinds of performances are welcome to the cabaret, please, contact Tiiti (tiiti.valonen(at)comets.fi).
